# Fake-News-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
NLP : Fake News Detector

### Project Objectives
In this project, I am going to focus on the following learning objectives:
1.	Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets
2.	Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
3.	Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words
4.	Understand the concept of tokenizer.
5.	Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.
6.	Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
7.	Build and train the deep learning model
8.	Access the performance of the trained model
